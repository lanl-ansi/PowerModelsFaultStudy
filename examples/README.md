# Examples

The examples in this folder are Pluto Notebooks, and can be run interactively with [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl).

To run an example

```julia
import Pkg

Pkg.add("Pluto")

import Pluto

Pluto.run()
```

Once your local instance of the Pluto server has launched the client page in your browser, you can navigate to one of the tutorials using the "Open from File" box.
